# Here we learn about formatting output with % & {} i.e. output can be produced by using %, {}.
# Let's understand
# with the following data in various approaches, viz,

name = "Govind"
age = 26
ht = 5.9

# Approach:0
print("name:", name, "\nage:", age, "\nheight:", ht)
# name:Govind
# age:26
# height:5.9

# approach_1 :
print(name, age, ht)
# output: Govind 26 5.9

# approach_2
print("Name is:", name)
print("Age is:", age)
print("Height is:", ht)
# output
# Name is: Govind
# Age is: 26
# Height is: 5.9

# approach_3:using % operator. Here data type is important.
print("Name:%s,Age:%d,height:%f" % (name, age, ht))
# Note: After closing inverted commas " comma (,) is not used.
# output: Name:Govind,Age:26,height:5.900000

# approach_4:using {} operator. Here data type is not important but order of value is important.
print("Name:{},Age:{},Height:{}".format(name, age, ht))
# note: Here after closing inverted commas " comma (,) is not used but ".format" is used.
# output: Name:Govind,Age:26,Height:5.9
# note: Here one's value can be assigned to another element like in below example
print("Name:{},Age:{},Height:{}".format(age, ht, name))
# Output: Name:26,Age:5.9,Height:Govind

# approach_5:using {} operator and INDEX OF THE VARIABLES. Here data type is not important
# but order of value is important.
print("Name:{0},Age:{1},Height:{2}".format(name, age, ht))
# OUTPUT:Name:Govind,Age:26,Height:5.9
# Note: Index starts from 0
# note: Here one's value can be assigned to another element like in below example
# by changing indicies of cariables
print("Name:{0},Age:{1},Height:{2}".format(age, ht, name))
# Output:Name:26,Age:5.9,Height:Govind
# note: Here one's value can be assigned to another element like in below example changing indicies of variables
print("Name:{1},Age:{1},Height:{1}".format(age, ht, name))
# Output:Name:5.9,Age:5.9,Height:5.9
