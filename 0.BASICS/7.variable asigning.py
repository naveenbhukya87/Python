# how data can be assigned to variables
# example_1
x = 10
y = 20
s = 'welcome'
a = 'A'
print(x, y, s, a)  # o/p: 10 20 welcome A

# above prog can be rewritten in another way
x, y, s, a = 10, 20, 'welcome', 'A'
# here x,y will be assigned with values 10,20 respectively
print(x, y, s, a)  # o/p 10 20 welcome A

# values can be interchanged or swapped simply like
x, y = 20, 30
print(x, y)  # output 20 30
x, y = y, x
'''
at first x,y will be assigned with values 10,20 respectively and with next step x will be assigned with 
y (which is 2) and y with x (which is 1)
'''
print(x, y)  # output 30 20 i.e values are interchanged

# assigning same value to many variables
x = y = z = 150
print(x, y, z)  # output is 150 150 150
