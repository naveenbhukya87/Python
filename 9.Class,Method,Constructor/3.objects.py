# MULTIPLE METHODS
# multiple methods can be created for same class because:
# Methods are independent to each other
# Each method occupies different memory location
# Nameless_object: no referenece obj is required and function can be called directly. SYNTAX: "class().method()"
# Named_object: referenece obj is required

    def mymeth(self):
        print("This is instance method")
