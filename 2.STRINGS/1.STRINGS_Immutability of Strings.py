# Assigning of strings: ' ' or " " or """ """ can be used

print(x)  # OUTPUT: ('a', 'b', 'c')

# Immutability of strings: Once the string is created, it can't be modified.
str1 = "govind"

# Since the string "govind" is same, its address is fixed even if we assigned it to another variable called 'str2'
