# Here values are iterated by using for loop
# NOTE:
# 1: For loop is used when initial value, final value and condition (increment/decrement) are known.
# 2: For loop, "RANGE" specification is very important.
# To print 1-10 numbers
for i in range(11):  # by default 'i' is assigned with value '0'
    print(i)  # OUTPUT: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# PROGRAM LOGIC: By default 0 is entered in 'i' and as it is below 0, 0 is printed & again enters the program and 1 is
# added & goes on until 10 & loop gets exit when i=11=11
# NOTE: Maximum value or range is not included. Here range is 11 but loop continued upto 10 only.

# To print even numbers from 1-10
for i in range(2, 11, 2):  # (intial value,maximum value, increment)
    print(i)  # output: 2 4 6 8 10
# PROGRAM LOGIC:2 is printed & again enters program & 2 is added & goes on until it becomes i=10+2=13 & get exited from loop
# NOTE: Here by default i is assigned with '2'
# NOTE: For block goes on executed for said range and then comes out of that block and

# To print odd numbers from 1-10
for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # (intial value,maximum value, increment)
    # NOTE: Here by default i is assigned with '1'
    print(i)  # output: 1 3 5 7 9
# PROGRAM LOGIC:1 is printed & again enters program & 2 is added & goes on until it becomes i=9+2=11 & get exited from loop
# NOTE: Here by default i is assigned with '2'

# To print numbers using decrement:
# To print 1-10 numbers in decreasing order
for i in range(10, 0, -1):  # (intial value,maximum value, decrement)
    # Here by default i is assigned with '10' and continues till 1 and
    print(i)  # output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
# PROGRAM LOGIC:10 is printed & again enters program & -1 is decreased & goes on until it becomes i=1-1=0 & get exited from loop
# NOTE: Here by default i is assigned with '2'
