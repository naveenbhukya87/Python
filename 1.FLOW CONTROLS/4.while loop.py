# Here we discuss about While-loop.
# NOTE:
# 1: while loop is used when initial value, final value and condition (increment/decrement) are not known.
# 2: For loop, "RANGE" specification is not required.

# To print 1-10 numbers in increasing order:
i = 1  # (INITIALIZATION)
while i <= 10:  # (CONDITION)
    print(i)
    i = i+1  # (INCREMENT or DECREMENT)
    # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# #Here increment or decrement is need, if not loop executes infinite times.

# To print 1-10 numbers in decreasing order:
i = 10
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i = i-1  # Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

# To print even numbers b/w 1-10
i = 2
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i+2  # Output: 2 4 6 8 10

# To print odd numbers b/w 1-10
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i+2  # Output: 1 3 5 7 9
